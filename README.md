## Next.js Weather app

A side project made in Next.js using the API from [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and hosted on Vercel.
The project uses the Weather API to fetch data from a location and render the UI accordingly. Besides the Weather API the browser navigator.geolocaion api was used to automatically set location to a users location.
